# Project-Meditation-Application

Let's go stress free with Meditaion- Meditation is the practice of intentionally spending time with our mind.
We take time out of our busy days to sit, breathe, and try to remain focused on our breath. 
Doing this helps us become more aware of our thoughts, act more compassionately toward ourselves and others, and connect with the present moment.
 Some of the times , it is hard to tackel a situation and Medidation helps one to make the mind stronger and work effectively.
 
 This project provides one with the timer to check the medidation timing along with this, this project helps the person in medidating with different background music. 
 It gives a sense of comfort via different music effects in the background.
